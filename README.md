# Santorini AI

This code seeks to implement the abstract board game Santorini with Python. The interfact of the game is implemented with Pygame, and the AI uses the minimax algorithm, optimized with alpha-beta pruning.

## Getting Started

I run this on Pycharm in Python 3.9. Users need pygame installed, and a computer with some graphics inferface. Some virtual environments (like Google Colab) lack the visual capability to show the pygame interface.
To play the game, run "santorini_ui.py" This will import all the relevant classes from other files.

### Prerequisites

Users must have some environment to run Python, with pygame installed. Note that pypy does not support pygame.

## Built With

* [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - IDE
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) - Game interface

## Versioning

Currently in beta testing. Version control using Git.
In the current version, the Game AI includes lots of blank space one each side. I plan to add further information, such as a turn history and AI decision-making visuals
in this space.
